## :wave: Introduction

As part of our commitment to promoting the Web3 gaming ecosystem in Polkadot, we offer tailored grants for promising game developers developing games that will eventually contribute to the overall ecosystem. In most cases, funding will be retroactive, based on several agreed-upon milestones that will require detailed planning and reporting to bounty curators. If you apply for funding your project gets into the primary check queue and can be:

- Approved (the project will move to milestone agreement) 
- Needs work (The project has been rejected with the possibility of revision)
- Denied (The project has been rejected without the chance of revision)

If the project is approved for funding, you will get a (group) of curators assigned who will be your point of contact throughout the delivery and check process of your project.

### Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a games bounty grant, applicants must:
- Be transparent about any other funding related to the project for which you are applying. This includes denied, approved, and ongoing funding requests.
- Overarching projects that have received funding from whatever source must be disclosed as well.
- Have a multi-sig as payout address, this multi-sig must at least have three signatories.
- Team members/studio must be stated
- ... 

This list will be updated soon.

## :pencil: Process

### 1. Application

   0. Please read our [FAQs](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/blob/master/docs/faq.md), and [Terms & Conditions](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/blob/master/docs/T%26Cs.md) to familiarize yourself the application and the program as a whole.
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/fork) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](applications/application-template.md)). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/master/applications/application-template.md) of the template inside the new one. Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**.
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review. Please refer to our [Games Bounty guidelines](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/blob/master/docs/gamesbounty_guidelines.md). To get an idea of what a strong application looks like, you can have a look at the following examples:  [1](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/blob/master/applications/project_bbb_1.md), [2](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/blob/master/applications/project_game_example1.md), [3](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/blob/master/applications/project_game_example2.md), [4](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/blob/master/applications/project_game_example3.md). Naturally, if you're only applying for a smaller funding that only consists of, say, a mini-game, you don't need to provide as much detail.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request in **our** main [Games Bounty repository](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty). The pull request should only contain _one new file_â€”the Markdown file you created from the template.
   6. You will see a comment template that contains a checklist. You can leave it as is and tick the checkboxes once the pull request has been created. Please read through these items and check all of them.

### 2. Application Review

   1. The [curators](#games-bounty-curators) can (and usually does) issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
   2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments _need to be included in the application_. You may address feedback by directly modifying your application and leaving a comment once you're done. Generally, if you don't reply within 2 weeks, the application will be closed due to inactivity, but you're always free to reopen it as long as it hasn't been rejected.
   3. When all requested changes are addressed, and the terms and conditions have been signed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` and share it internally with the rest of the committee.
   4. The application will be accepted and merged as soon as it receives the required number of approvals (see [levels](#level_slider-levels)) or closed after two weeks of inactivity. Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is accepted will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

### 3. Milestone Delivery and Payment

   Milestones are to be delivered on the [Games Bounty Delivery](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty/) repository following the [process](https://github.com/PolkadotPlay/GamesBounty#mailbox-milestone-delivery-process) described therein.
